This series of posts owes its existence to several things.

First of all, I happen to have Kindle Paperwhite 1st generation model, which has
served me admirably so far. Alas, its peaceful days of intended use were over 
once I saw [this post][kindleberry-pi-post] on Raspberry Pi blog. Yes, Raspberry
Pi, the ubiquitous credit card sized computer. It would be the second thing. 
Raspberry Pi has intrigued me for some time now, but I’ve always lacked a 
project idea interesting enough to justify taking the plunge (which didn’t stop 
me from trying to get a brand new [Pi Zero][pi-zero]. Lack of supply did, 
though).

Thing number three is that I’m really into games where you constantly die in 
random locations - roguelikes! Known also as “procedural death labyrinths” and 
“death crawls”, these games are perfect for playing in console.

So in addition to braving [lynx][lynx-link] for browsing and [vim][vim-link] 
for all my text-related needs, I’ve decided to make my Kindleberry Pi-to-be a 
console game station. I guess we will see how that works out further down the 
road.

This series would not exist without [a comprehensive guide][guide-link].
Comprehensive as it may be, though, I still had troubles following it, dumb 
human that I am. Documenting my experiences as a manual of sorts might help 
someone out there, or at least help me achieve a semblance of an organized 
thought process.

So here it is, then, my journey towards Kindleberry Pi, written mostly from 
memory and therefore woefully incomplete:

[Part 1 - Downgrade]({% post_url 2015-12-10-downgrade-kindle %})

[Part 2 - Jailbreak]({% post_url 2015-12-14-kindle-jailbreak %})

[Part 3 - Extend]({% post_url 2015-12-15-usbnetwork-extend %})
