I have been playing [Ace Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney) games a lot lately.  
This post in particular is about "Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth".

### Context
I have played through Ace Attorney 1-3 before back in the olden [DS Lite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite) days, in English. I had only just begun the journey through the turmulous oceans of Japanese language, and my boat was not up to the snuff when it came to the text-heavy visual novel kind of games. It was more like a raft, really. Lately, though, I have been having bouts of nostalgia towards my time in the mountains of eastern Hiroshima, plus the boat (which is the knowledge of Japanese) became more like a proper boat. Metaphors, eh? In short, I wanted to practice my language skills and play some good games along the way! So I have ploughed through parts 1-4, 3DS versions, in about a month. Suprisingly, the games were not difficult to understand at all, although I'm sure some of the finer character name-based jokes went over my head. Only upon reaching part #5 did I suddenly discover the urge to write about it. The urge strong enough to bring my Jekyll blog back from the dead!

### Series intro
Ace Attorney rightfully claims to be one of the best visual novel series in business. Captivating plot, endearing characters, satisfying mechanics where you advance the plot by building up and arguing your case in court. What's not to like! As an added bonus, it's like one long reading comprehension test when playing in Japanese. Maybe I will write about parts 1-4 in the future.
 
### Obvious differences 
There are several differences when it comes to 逆転検事 vs the previous games in the series.
1. Change of protagonist! Titular attorney Phoenix Wright this time is replaced by his arch-enemy (and best friend?) Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth has been the protagonist briefly in the 3rd game, giving us a foretaste of his calm, level-headed and at times charmingly awkward inner monologue. This time it's Edgeworth all the way.
2. Addition of third-person perspective! At first I was a bit sceptical about this due to how character sprites looked against animated backgrounds, but this was mostly due to playing scaled up DS game on a new 3ds XL model (see the next bullet point). Third-person perspective gave animators some really cool means of expression, my favourite so far is Detective Gumshoe stomping ground! I wonder if Investigations in this regard has been a testing bed of sorts for the excellent [Ghost Trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Trick:_Phantom_Detective). I would also not be against a "Beat 'em up" game in this style.
3. DS version all the way! Unlike parts 1-4, Investigations was originally released for DS and never re-released for 3DS or Switch. This means a slightly out-of-date experience when it comes to visuals, that are either scaled up or look a bit too small on bigger 3DS XL screens. I might dig out my DS Lite for Investigations 2, but after a while scaled graphics do not look so bad.

### Warm, fuzzy similarities 
The core of the game, which is a brilliantly written, illustrated and animated visual novel, stays the same. You are still solving crimes by looking for clues and having passionate arguments. There are references to the cases from the previous parts.

### Premature conclusion
I have not actually finished the game yet, having reached only the 4th case. However, my desire to share my thoughts was too strong.
Fun fact,
