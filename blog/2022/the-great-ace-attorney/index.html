<p>That's a whole lot of visual novels. Almost all of them have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS">3DS</a> version available or at least can be run on 3DS, which over the course of its lifetime has turned into a real homebrew powerhouse and the best retro handheld, hands-down.</p>
<p>But what about the final chapter of the series, The Great Ace Attorney, (mostly) the title of this post?<br />
Well, it is simply wonderful.</p>
<p>Looking back at the first entries made for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance">GBA</a> it is hard to believe just how far the series has come. On the other hand, it is still, in its heart, a story. If you like the tone of it, anything else is but a pleasant bonus<sup>†</sup><span class="aside"><sup>†</sup>Not sure I'd read a plain text book version, though. Games are cooler books with interactive illustrations.</span>. </p>
<p>But even the story has matured a lot, got bigger both in depth and breadth, and acquired a real <em>weight</em>. The Great Ace Attorney had to be split into 2 parts to carry it, and those are not small games by any means. I could have literally sailed to Japan on an antique steam ship in the time it took for me to experience both.</p>
<p>The amount of love poured into every detail, every corner of the elaborately constructed virtual space the story inhabits and that you can stick a stylus into is nothing short of saintly. The real world would have come apart at the seams if examined with the same level of scrutiny, but not this world.</p>
<p>In a way, I did go on a trip, and I'm sitting here now, home at last, exhausted, satisfied, slightly wistful. 
Honestly, this was a great thing to experience in the middle of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Other things of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>motion capture tech is a great feat for visual novels, who'd have known</li>
<li>Natsume Souseki! His &quot;the moon is beautiful, isn't it?&quot; is going to haunt me</li>
<li>lots and lots of fascinating bits of trivia on life both in England and Japan at the beginning of the 20th century</li>
<li>the prosecutor is amazing, at least on par with Miles Edgeworth</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, The Great Ace Attorney is the best game in the series so far. Would I be disappointed if no other games appear? <em>Definitely</em>. Would I be satisfied with the series going out on such a strong note? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p>
<p>I have to admit that Ace Attorney Investigations, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice<sup>†</sup><span class="aside"><sup>†</sup>The character art &amp; animation were taken to a jaw-dropping new level in Ace Attorney 5 &amp; 6; they are worth playing for that alone. </span>, on the other hand, read very differently and for me personally were less enjoyable. They are still good games, just don't expect familiar characters to sound, well, familiar.</p>
<p>Playing the whole series and retro-gaming in general has worked out well for me, so I will be doing more of that. Currently I am using a refurbished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi#Larger_model">DSi XL</a><sup>†</sup><span class="aside"><sup>†</sup>Despite 3DS being a powerhouse and all, upscaled DS games look better on DSi XL. Or maybe I got too much into collecting retro handhelds, hm.</span> to play through ポケモン不思議のダンジョン - Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - a pretty cool mix of roguelike and Pokemon formulas.</p>
